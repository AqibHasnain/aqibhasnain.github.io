In biological organisms, genetic activity is often highly nonlinear, making it difficult to design libraries of promoters to act as reporters of the cell state. We make use of the Koopman observability gramian to develop an algorithm for optimal sensor (or reporter) placement for discrete time nonlinear dynamical systems to ease the difficulty of design of the promoter library.
