We show how Koopman operators can be used to quantify impact of synthetic gene circuits on their host. We quantify the impact of a NAND circuit on E. coli using by modeling high-throughput RNAseq measurements collected from wild-type E. coli, single gate components transformed in E. coli, and the NAND circuit composed from individual gates in E. coli. We showcase how Koopman subspace functions encode increasing circuit interference on E. coli chassis dynamics.
