We consider the problem of learning a predictive model for population cell growth dynamics as a function of the media conditions. We show theoretically that Hankel DMD can be used to obtain a solution of the NAR model. We show that it identifies a constrained NAR model and to obtain a more general solution, we define a causal state space system using 1-step, 2-step,...,{\tau}-step predictors of the NAR model and identify a Koopman operator for this model using extended dynamic mode decomposition.
