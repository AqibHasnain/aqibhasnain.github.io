 We frame the analog computing challenge of generating a steady state input-output function inside living cells. To program the steady state, a data-driven approach is taken wherein an approximation of the Koopman operator, identified via deep dynamic mode decomposition, is used to describe the dynamics of the system linearly. The new representation of the dynamics are then used to solve an optimization problem for the input which maximizes a direction in state space.
