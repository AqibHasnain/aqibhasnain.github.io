Hi! I'm Aqib (pronounced ah-kib), a mechanical engineer turned synthetic and systems biologist. I was a graduate student in the [Biological Control Group](https://yeung.me.ucsb.edu/) at University of California Santa Barbara from 2019 - 2023. My research took inspiration from control and dynamical systems to develop computational tools for studying and designing synthetic biological circuits and sensors.

I'm excited to have the opportunity to be able to start as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Environmental Genomics & Systems Biology](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/egsb/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab  

Feel free to reach out!
