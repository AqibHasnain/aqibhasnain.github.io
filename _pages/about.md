Hi! I'm Aqib (pronounced ah-kib), a mechanical engineer turned computational and synthetic biologist. Currently, I am a graduate student in the [Biological Control Group](https://yeung.me.ucsb.edu/) at University of California Santa Barbara. My research takes inspiration from control and dynamical systems to develop computational tools for studying and designing synthetic biological circuits and sensors. I have developed numerous synthetic biological devices to validate developed computational and theoretical methods. My current interests are in developing matrix factorization techniques to integrate time-series, multi-modal 'omic data with application in i) understanding how and why synthetic gene circuits impart mechanisms of adaptation in microbes, and ii) how single-gene mutant co-fitnesses can be mapped to optimal multi-gene mutant fitness. I have experience in many facets of machine learning and have made contributions to a relatively new dimensionality reduction technique known as [dynamic mode decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mode_decomposition). I am also interested and am proficient in the development of algorithms for analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and multi-omics measurements. I developed single-cell dynamic mode decomposition (during my time at Cellarity) for feature extraction, improving the mapping from single-cell dynamics to phenotypes in the context of disease biology.

*My graduate research largely focused on learning dynamics from large biological datasets at the intersection of machine learning and systems biology. This image depicts the transcriptome dynamics of a yeast mutant, lacking key cell cycle genes, projected in two dimensions by dynamic mode decomposition. The modes define a reduced dimension space in which, for the two coordinates shown here, separate genes which respond to the mutations and those which do not.* 

A bit more about me: 

I occasionally enjoy an algorithm or paper that I came across so much that I feel the need to write about it or apply it to some dataset that I have generated or that is publicly available. You can find a small sample of these writing in the `Blog Posts` page of this site. 

I very much enjoy the process of doing independent research in a collaborative environment. And I also absolutely love doing curiosity-driven research (or so called [Night Science](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1800-6)). You can find a list of publications, many of which are currently under review in journals, in the `Publications` page of this site.
