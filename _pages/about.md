Heyo, I'm Aqib (pronounced ah-kib), a mechanical engineer turned computational and synthetic biologist. Currently, I am a graduate student in the [Biological Control Group](https://yeung.me.ucsb.edu/). My research takes inspiration from control and dynamical systems to develop computational tools for studying and designing synthetic biological circuits and sensors. My current interests are in developing matrix factorization techniques to integrate time-series, multi-modal 'omic data with application in i) understanding how and why synthetic gene circuits impart mechanisms of adaptation in microbes, and ii) how single-gene mutant co-fitnesses can be mapped to optimal multi-gene mutant fitness. I have experience in many facets of machine learning and have made contributions to a relatively new dimensionality reduction technique known as dynamic [mode decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mode_decomposition). I am also interested in single-cell 'omics and have developed algorithms to map single-cell dynamics to desired phenotypes in the context of disease biology.  

Feel free to reach out!

*Each phase space trajectory represents a chaotic attractor of a dynamical system, however some of the trajectories are outpaintings from a large text-to-image model. Some are obviously fake and others not -- can you guess which attractors are fake?*
