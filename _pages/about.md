Heyo, I'm Aqib (pronounced ah-kib), a mechanical engineer turned computational and synthetic biologist. Currently, I am a graduate student in the [Biological Control Group](https://yeung.me.ucsb.edu/). My research takes inspiration from control and dynamical systems to develop computational tools for studying and designing synthetic biological circuits and sensors. Most recently, my research has focused on developing high-throughput experiments to understand how and why synthetic gene circuits impart non-natural mechanisms of adaptation in microbes. I am also interested single-cell 'omics and have developed algorithms to map single-cell dynamics to desired phenotypes in the context of disease biology. 

Feel free to reach out!

*Each phase space trajectory represents a chaotic attractor of a dynamical system, however some of the trajectories are outpaintings from a large text-to-image model. Some are obviously fake and others not -- can you guess which attractors are fake?*
