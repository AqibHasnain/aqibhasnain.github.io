TA'd for the three quarter-series of courses on thermodynamics and heat transfer. Main responsibilities were answering student's questions, hosting office hours, and grading. I was also responsible for delivering two lectures, the first on thermodynamic lookup tables and how to perform single and double interpolation, and the second on radiative heat transfer analysis using view factors.
